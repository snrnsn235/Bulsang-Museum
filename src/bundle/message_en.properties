introduce1 = Welcome to the National Buddha Museum, where history and culture live and the past, present, and future coexist.
introduce2 = The National Buddha Museum, which opened a few days ago, is currently collecting cultural assets under the determination to display Buddhist statues covering the Three Kingdoms Period and the Joseon Dynasty. As a result We were able to rent various cultural assets and works such as "Geumdong Maitreuk Bodhisattva Bansaeyusang," which was on display at the National Museum of Korea. Our museum will try to understand Buddha's heart by looking at the gentle Buddha's face and to make it an exhibition that can heal your heart. Have a pleasant time.

sir = The Director's words
sir1 = Hello, I'm the director of the National Buddha Museum, "Anyone."
sir2 = Since I was young, I have been interested in history, especially Buddhist cultural assets, and visited various museums. So later, I had a dream of displaying these cultural assets myself, and I realized it and showed it to you. Knowing that it is still not enough, I will display more cultural assets in the future, and I promise to create cultural life and facilities that will help local residents. Thank you.
